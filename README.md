### Here, I have uploaded some of the Data Science Projects, I have worked on recently.


#### 1. [State Farm Distracted Driver Detection](https://github.com/djmk/Data-Science-Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/State%20Farm%20Distracted%20Driver%20Detection)  
    This is an old competition from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection/data).
    In this competition we are given driver images, each taken in a car with a driver doing something in the car (texting, eating, talking on the phone, makeup, reaching behind, etc). Our goal is to predict the likelihood of what the driver is doing in each picture. 

    In our project, we have trained the dataset using the following models and compared their performance:-

    1. **Simple Dense Model**
    2. **CNN Model**
    3. **VGG16 Model**
    4. **RestNet50 Model**
    5. **Yolo v8 Model**
